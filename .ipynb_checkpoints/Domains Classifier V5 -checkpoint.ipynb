    "# 1. NLP Exploration 2: Webscraping \n",
    "This exploration is an extension of **Domains Classifier V4**. We looked at just the domain name in that example, and utilized segmentation and a few other things in order to create a **vocabulary** of words that occur in the domain name. This vocabulary then one hot encoded in order to represent inputs, and then these inputs were fed into a **random forest** in order to try and map to the correct output class. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to try and extended that by making use of **Webscraping**. Working with the same data set we will scrape the associated webpages and try to gather as much information as we can that may help us make predictions. Some things to note:\n",
    "1. We will start by just looking at the home page. This clearly does not give us 100% of the information we may need, but it will be the first iteration.\n",
    "2. We will also only be looking at visible text and not at css class names, commented out code, or anything else that would not be visible to a user. \n",
    "2. Based on the number of domains we have scores for (2000) we will need to be wary of how large we let our vocabulary size grow to. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, the first step is for us to actually scrape the home page of each domain. We can start by importing our necessary modules and loading in our data. "
